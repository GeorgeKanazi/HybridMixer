# HybridMixer
A PyTorch implementation of a "Hybrid MLP-Mixer" that introduces a lightweight Depthwise Separable Convolutional stem. This modification injects spatial inductive bias, significantly improving generalization on small datasets like CIFAR-10 (+5.56%) and CIFAR-100 (+6.83%) with negligible parameter overhead.
